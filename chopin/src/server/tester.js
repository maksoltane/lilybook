The first section, Larghetto (mm.40), features an intricate, elaborately ornamental melody over an even quaver bass. The second section, labelled doppio movimento (double speed), resembles a scherzo with dotted quaver-semi quaver melody, semiquavers in a lower voice in the right hand, and large jumps in the bass. The final section is a shortened version of the first (14 bars rather than 24) with characteristic cadenzas and elaboration, finishing with an arpeggio on F♯ major, falling at first, then dying away.",

This popular nocturne is in rounded binary form (A, A, B, A, B, A) with coda, C. The A and B sections become increasingly ornamented with each recurrence. The penultimate bar utilizes considerable rhythmic freedom, indicated by the instruction, senza tempo (without tempo). Nocturne in E-flat major opens with a legato melody, mostly played piano, containing graceful upward leaps which becomes increasingly wide as the line unfolds. This melody is heard again three times during the piece. With each repetition, it is varied by ever more elaborate decorative tones and trills. The nocturne also includes a subordinate melody, which is played with rubato.",

Johnson also calls the piece \"one of Chopin's most graceful essays in fioritura ornamental practices\". Huneker states that the piece \"really contains but one subject, and is a song of the sweet summer of two souls, for there is obviously meaning in the duality of voices.\" He also claims that the piece is \"harmonically most interesting\".

The piece is full of coloratura ornaments, and ends with a wide chord in the left hand accompanied with right hand triplets in a high octave to lead to a legatissimo smorzando adagio (senza tempo).",

Chopin dedicated this work to his older sister, Ludwika Chopin, with the statement: \"To my sister Ludwika as an exercise before beginning the study of my second Concerto\". First published 26 years after the composer's death, the piece is usually referred to as Lento con gran espressione, from its tempo marking. It is sometimes also called Reminiscence. The piece was famously played by Holocaust survivor Natalia Karp for the Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, with Goeth being so impressed with the rendition, that he spared Karp's life.",

The second section is then played with, again, the right-hand playing the melody and the left-hand accompanying with bass notes and a chord. Although there are occasional changes to this pattern, for example the left-hand plays a sustained minim with a crotchet chord above. The main theme then comes back in with some variations to the first two times it was played: a triplet phrase is added to the 3rd bar of the section. The second section is again repeated with no variations, followed immediately by the first section again with the triplet sequence.",

The first is titled Moderato and is in 4/4 time; the second section is titled Romance and is in 6/8 time.

It is written in the style of a Venetian barcarolle, which, according to Dubal, is engendered by the main theme's \"euphonious thirds and sixths\". Huneker commented that \"pianists usually take the first part too fast, the second too slowly\" and play the piece like an étude. Friskin commented that the sixths \"require care to get evenness of tone control.\" The piece has the structure ABABA, somewhat unusual for a Chopin nocturne. The melody in thirds and sixths is similarly unusual, all other Chopin nocturnes opening with single-voice melodies.",

        "description": "Frédéric Chopin composed his Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor, Op. 58, in 1844 and dedicated it to Countess Emilie de Perthuis. As his last sonata for solo piano, it has been suggested that this was his attempt to address the criticisms of his earlier Sonata No. 2, Op. 35. Along with the previous sonata, this is considered to be one of Chopin's most difficult compositions, both technically and musically. Pianist Stephen Hough considers the sonata more difficult than Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor.",

The work consists entirely of rapid arpeggios and harmonic modulations based on A-flat major. Robert Schumann praised this work in a dissertation on the Études; calling it \"a poem rather than a study\", he coined for it the alternate name \"Aeolian Harp\". It is also sometimes known as \"The Shepherd Boy,\" following an unsupported tale by Kleczyński that Chopin advised a pupil to picture a shepherd boy taking refuge in a grotto to avoid a storm playing the melody on his flute.",

The Mazurka starts with a piano section, in which the central theme is stated, which revolves around oscillating triplets and heavy accents on the third beat of each bar. A second theme is then stated fortissimo, in a passage full of sforzandos and wedge accents. The original theme is then stated forte, but quickly decrescendos. These two passages end with repeats.",

The strength of emotion is articulated by the expression of the melody which complements the initial idea. It explodes, shattering the melody's calm passage with sudden leaps and runs before picking up the broken thread a moment later. This music sounds convulsively tense, played agitato, and like a nervous speech. The agitation soon subsides, however, giving way to the principal melody. This comes about in a wondrous and beautiful way. The melody returns with greater calm and poise than before the eruption of that inner storm.",

Once finished, it wasn't published until his move to Paris, where he dedicated it to Baron Nathaniel von Stockhausen, the Hanoverian ambassador to France. Robert Schumann commented that, \"I received a new Ballade from Chopin. It seems to be a work closest to his genius (although not the most ingenious) and I told him that I like it best of all his compositions.

The piece is 65 measures long and, unusually, ends in the tonic minor key, B minor, although some editions (such as those by Rafael Joseffy as well as Chopin's student Carl Mikuli) and performances (such as that by Arthur Rubinstein) end with a B major chord, which has the effect of a Picardy third in the context of the minor-mode coda.

Based on the barcarole rhythm and mood, it features a sweepingly romantic and slightly wistful tone. Many of the technical figures for the right hand are thirds and sixths, while the left features very long reaches over an octave.",

It was first published in 1833 in France, Germany, and England as the first piece of his Études Op. 10. This study in reach and arpeggios focuses on stretching the fingers of the right hand. The American music critic James Huneker (1857–1921) compared the \"hypnotic charm\" that these \"dizzy acclivities and descents exercise for eye as well as ear\" to the frightening staircases in Giovanni Battista Piranesi's prints of the Carceri d'invenzione. Virtuoso pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who refused to perform this étude in public, said, \"For me, the most difficult one of all (the études) is the C Major, the first one, Op. 10, No. 1.\"",

Robert Schumann, who had dedicated his Kreisleriana, Op. 16, to Chopin, received the dedication of this Ballade in return. The piece has been criticized by prominent pianists and musicologists, including its dedicatee Schumann, as a less ingenious work than the first. There is some degree of disagreement as to its inspiration, with the claim often made that it was inspired by Adam Mickiewicz's poem Świtezianka, the lake of Willis, but this claim is unsubstantiated, and the Ballade No. 3 is sometimes attributed to this poem as well.",

Of this one, Niecks wrote: The second nocturne (in E flat major) differs in form from the other nocturnes in...that it has no contrasting second section, the melody flowing onward from beginning to end in a uniform manner. The monotony of the unrelieved sentimentality does not fail to make itself felt. One is seized by an ever-increasing longing to get out of this oppressive atmosphere, to feel the fresh breezes and warm sunshine, to see smiling faces and the many-coloured dress of Nature, to hear the rustling of leaves, the murmuring of streams, and voices which have not yet lost the clear, sonorous ring that joy in the present and hope in the future impart.",
