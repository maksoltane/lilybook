# Sonatina in G major, Anh. 5, No. 1, 1st Movement

The Sonatina in G major is composition for solo piano attributed to Ludwig van Beethoven (listed as Anh. 5 No. 1 in the Kinskyâ€“Halm Catalogue). Since the work was published in Hamburg, Germany after Beethoven's death, its authenticity is doubted, as it uses styles never seen by Beethoven before.
